            <p>Although English is not the most spoken language in the world, it is the official 
                language in 53 countries and is spoken as a first language by around 400 
                million people worldwide. But thatâ€™s not all, it is also the most 
                common second language in the world. According to the British Council, 
                by 2020 about two billion people in the world will be studying English.

                Therefore, it is highly likely that if you meet someone from another country, 
                you will both be able to speak English. It gives you an open door to the world 
                and helps you communicate with global citizens.</p>
